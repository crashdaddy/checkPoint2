My Final Project for Austin Coding Academy's Full Stack Web Developer course is called **Lotto Lab**

## Description

*LottoLab* provides the user with a suite of statistical and data-analysis tools to facilitate pattern-tracking and discovery from historic and current Megamillions Lotto results.

**Functionality:**

Lotto results are retrieved from the Megamillions API and aggregated into a mySQL database for historic record-keeping. The mySQL database then provides an API to the front-end to deliver the data to the user.

The front-end provides tools to highlight the data according to the user's desired criteria: primes, evens, odds, frequency, etc.

There are also tools to display the number of times each number has been drawn during the lotto's history, as well as the length of days since a certain number has been drawn last.

Lotto Lab provides no predictions of upcoming lotto drawings, but instead provides the user with the tools to make their own predictions.
